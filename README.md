# How Many Experts Are Enough? Towards Optimal Semantic Specialization for Mixture-of-Experts (AAAI 2026)

This repository contains the implementation of **MASS (Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization)**, a novel approach that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with adaptive expert expansion for both **Language** and **Vision** tasks. MASS dynamically adjusts the number of experts based on gradient dynamics, enabling efficient domain generalization and specialization.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Expert Expansion**: Dynamically expands experts during training based on gradient-driven semantic drift signals
- **MinTau Routing**: Novel adaptive gate mechanism that selects experts based on cumulative routing mass
- **Experiments**: Specialized for both language (GLUE tasks) and vision (domain generalization) tasks
